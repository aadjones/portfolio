  <div>This began as precision.</div>

  <div>
    One image, coaxed into being by a prompt. Then another. Then another.<br />
    Each time, the same instructions. But each time, more noise. More forgetting.
  </div>

  <div>
    <em>Degradation</em> is what happens when we reverse the diffusion process of text-to-image generation. The image is born of noise, and returns to noise.
  </div>

  <div>
    The result: a looping entropy. Birds that flock into a melting streak of abstraction. A piano that smears into a grid of noise. A cathedral made of feathers, or a feather made of cathedrals.
  </div>
</div>

<FieldNote>
Noise to noise.
